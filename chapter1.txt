//my first git lesson

go to working directory
git init // to initialize your git repository
ls -a // to list all hidden files like the .git
git status// to see what files are in the staging area = being tracked
git add chapter1.txt // to add a file to staging area
git commit -m "complete chapter1" // commit to repository under version control -m to add message always use present tense
git log // to see what commits have been made
git add . // adds all files in working directory to staging area
git diff chapter3.txt // check what are the changes since last commit
git checkout chapter3.txt // revert to last saved version of chapter 3

//to save remotely
create new repository on github and copy its link
git remote add origin https://github.com/zbarbir/Story.git //it's telling local repository that we've created a remote one and give it its location
//origin is name of remote repository, keep it as is
git push -u origin master//push local repository onto remote one called called origin
//-u links up local to remote (called origin) to the branch called (master) (it's the default branch)
